            <p>
                World Wide Foods is Ireland's largest supplier of ethnic foods, the company has been on a steady rise
                since the last couple of years, but their design didn't stand the test of time. World Wide Foods was
                given a complete do over in terms of logo design and their overall branding to reflect the company's
                growing presence in the market.
            </p>
            <div class="modal-btn-github">
                <a href="https://www.behance.net/nomansanauf5ae" class="slide-btn" target="_blank">Behance </a>
            </div>
            <h1 class="about-h1 modal-h1">Result</h1>
            <p>
                The goal of the entire branding design was to reinvigorate the company's brand, but also to stay
                simplistic. To not veer to far off the mark, I kept the initial designs of the logo and letterhead and
                improved upon it. The most important thing was proper spacing and typography. Naturally, people want to
                fill as much white space as possible with information like marketing but that ruins the design. Spacing
                and typography is a key aspect of every good design. I kept the original logo, and added some much
                needed spacing as well as changing the font. The changes made were subtle but noticeable enough. <br><br>

                <!-- My next order of business was business cards. Most of World Wide Foods's business was based on word of mouth and its existing customer base so business cards weren't exactly a priority for them to get right. Keeping in line with a simple and minimal design approach, the business card front was the company's new logo and some design flair to keep things inline but fun. The back houses a very subtle background pattern with icons indicating the mode of contact and its details.-->

                I went with a different approach to letterhead design, with the top half housing all the company
                details like contact and address along with the company logo on stealth black background. Again, I made
                use of adequate spacing and a sans-serif font Montserrat that draws the eye and make reading larger
                text blocks much easier. I used a cursive font Alex Brush at the end as a sort of signature. It blends
                well with the overall design and makes it look pleasing and professional.

                World Wide Foods is an eCommerce website that lets its customers order food supplies from the comfort
                of their home. World Wide Foods is Ireland's largest supplier of ethnic foods, and an online presence
                helped them reach new heights, as well dramatically increasing sales. Unlike traditional eCommerce
                websites, World Wide Foods is more of an order portal for its customers.
            </p>
            <div class="modal-btn-github">

            </div>
            <h1 class="about-h1 modal-h1">What I Did</h1>
            <p>
                World Wide Foods's website needed a complete revamp, with the addition of an all-new ordering system
                for its customers. Customers needed to call and order supplies that they needed, and depending on the
                time of the day, or even night, employees either were too busy or not available at all times. The
                addition of eCommerce into the website is intended to bridge that gap and to allow customers to cycle
                through the enourmous product library of World Wide Foods and order whatever they want. <br><br>

                The design was decided to be flat and clean with a focus on the company's product offerings. I opted to
                use WordPress and WooCommerce with this project, with the latter's ability to easily add, edit and
                delete products of different types. The most important was WooCommerce's ability to add variable
                products and easily editable templates that I could shape to the company's needs. <br><br>

                Using Kalium theme as a base, I edited the WooCommerce templates and functions so that existing
                customers can order products without actually seeing the price. This decision was taken because all of
                the company's customers are catering customers and the pricing of products varies quite a bit. The
                ordering system allowed us to check any customers orders, verify it and ship the order. The order now
                and pay later system was heavily used by the company and it was implemented in the website as well.<br><br>

                Additionally, I implemented a QR Code generator on each product type. These QR Codes were then printed
                onto the company's product catalog, so any potential or existing customer can check the catalog,
                monthly offers and just scan the QR Code and ben taken to that particular product's page to order. QR
                Codes were also implemented in the invoice, which basically allowed the company's employee to scan the
                QR Code nad confirm the order instead of manually writing it out and confirming it.<br><br>

                Overall, the client was extremely happy with the result and the system will be implemented and
                regularly used once testing is finished. New features being added include using WooCommerce's APIs to
                integrate World Wide Foods's EPOS system with WooCommerce so managing stock, orders and payment is more
                streamlined and easier.

                Sams up is crowdfunding website akin to kickstarter and a blog. Sams up's main focus is the music
                industry within the japanese market to facilitate and allow aspiring musicians to gain exposure and
                promote their music. Sams up is also a crowdfunding website, akin to kickstarter that allows users to
                start their own crowdfunding campaigns. Sams up was built with the japanese market and musicians in
                mind.

            <p>
                My role on this project was take the design given to me by the client and translate that into a real
                website. My first order of business was to develop a platform for the blog as that was a priority for
                the client. I choose to go the WordPress route with the website because of it being the most popular
                CMS and would allow non-technical people to easily log in and post content without any technical know
                how. The layout was decided to be content heavy, with section dedicated to each of the main categories
                and a sidebar to showcase the most popular posts. <br><br>

                The posts layout was designed completely from scratch to adhere to the client's design. Social exposure
                was a priority, so the social buttons, along with post tags were positioned before the main image. To
                allow easy readability, spacing was strategically added and posts were broken between multiple pages.
                The pagination used AJAX so there were no page refreshes. This allowed for a great user experience.
                Another important change was to remove the author bio and visibility, and in turn promote the artists
                who was being written about or interviewed. I instead created a layout to showcase the artist bio, and
                below that details about their upcoming album or record. A profile section was also created for artists
                question. Again, a popular posts sidebar was also added in the single posts layout.

                GC Clinic was designed and developed as a concept for a small clinic. GC Clinic as a concept was to be
                a place where quality treatments are offered, and the website was designed to reflect that. I chose
                muted colors and minimal design. From a design perspective, I trimmed all the fat, and chose to focus
                on the clinic and the services it offers. GC Clinic is also unique in the sense that it allows patients
                to schedule, cancel and connect with doctors online through a custom built system. Similarly, doctors
                are also able to check any appointments, re-schedule them and check any patient information they want.

            <p>
                The process for thos project was one big learning experience, PHP and MySQL were things I'd used very
                sparingly until GC Clinic. Essentially, to ease my learning curve and to better structure the project,
                I divided my workflow into two different parts. I built and designed the front-end of GC Clinic, and
                then the backend. <br><br>
                I could have easily used WordPress and its gigantic library of plugins to make GC Clinic, but I
                intended on deep diving into PHP and MySQL given how prevalent they are on the web. The great thing
                about learning PHP and MySQL was the deep understanding of WordPress that I got from it, which helped
                me alot on my future projects.

                I designed GC Clinic to be very minimal with lots of spacing so the content is pleasing to the eye of
                end-user. The colors chosen complement each other and are very muted. The problem with a lot of
                websites today is they try to do too much at once and the UI gets very cluterred. My goal with GC
                Clinic was to just get out of the way, write up the important pieces and allow the user to do what they
                came to do. Its certainly different in a sense that many websites similar to GC Clinic don't normally
                go for minimal design, but if done right, it can be pulled off. <br><br>

                For better code-readability, the backend code was divided into lots of modules. The user sign up and
                log ins are done securely and all the passwords in the database are properly hashed. Similarly, all
                input fields were validated and sanitized. The database contains three user roles - admin, staff and
                customers. With the latter being the only one able to sign up from the front-end while staff are added
                by the admin user. When users log in, the system checks whether the user is either 'staff' or
                'customer', and displays user specific menus.<br><br>

                A secure and proper lost password functionality was also added. I also created an admin workspace so to
                speak, the admin specific area allows admin to add or delete users and monitor the entire system
                without actually writing any code. Although, not yet implemented, my next goal was to add CMS
                functionality so admin can add or delete content, much like WordPress can from the admin dashboard and
                to add patient diagnostics and reports.
